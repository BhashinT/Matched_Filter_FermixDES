# Matched_Filter_FermixDES

The repository contains texts that assist with the understanding of the matched filtering formalism discussed in Thakore et. al. 
The text titled "Matched_Filter_Chi_square.pdf" discusses a connection between the matched filter SNR and a null chi-squared value. 
Next, "maximum_likelihood_derivative.pdf" talks about the derivative of the expression for the matched filter, while "proof_matched_filter.pdf" talks about the proof behind the matched filter optimization.
